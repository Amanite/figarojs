FigaroJS
========

FigaroJS is a clone of [Figaro-Ocaml](https://github.com/Amanite/figarocaml), a script generating similar comments to those that can be found on the online newspaper [leFigaro.fr](http://lefigaro.fr).
Instead of being coded OCaml, it's in Javascript, to be used by anyone possessing a browser.
